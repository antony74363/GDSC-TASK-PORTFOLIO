# GDSC-TASK-PORTFOLIO
Based on the task's definition i have assumed that the portfolio's info 
doesn't have to be true and there is no need to create seperate websites 
for the topics on the top menu
also the website is not suitable for mobile viewing and the code is not 
segregated to be easily readable. i was on a 3 day trip and had to code
while travelling
i hope the website is good enough. if not, thank you for giving me this 
opportunity to get back on track and learn and i really mean it.
